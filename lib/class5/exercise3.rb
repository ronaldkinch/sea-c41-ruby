# Replace the `records` and `database` methods with your solutions from
# exercises 1 and 2.
#
# Then write a program that saves the corporate buzzwords -- in YAML format --
# to anyone's `lib/class5/database.yml` file and displays the result.
#
# So if Tim runs this program successfully:
#
#   $ ruby exercise3.rb
#   Saved 5 records to /Users/tim/sea-c21-ruby/lib/class5/database.yml
#
# Then his database needs to contain the following YAML content:
#
#   $ cat database.yml
#    ---
#    - Incentivized methodologies
#    - Seemless innovation
#    - Corporate synergy
#    - Scalable globalization
#    - Monetized assets
#
# TIP: Read section 11.4 carefully.
